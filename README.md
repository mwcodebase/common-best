I often find myself Googling "best X in Y"... for example: "best ramen in NY". What I usually do is click through the top couple results and find the resteraunts most frequently mentioned by the different sites/articles/etc. This tool is simply meant to automate that process. Run it, provide the search query, and it will output the results that have at least 2 mentions, ordered by the number of mentions.
